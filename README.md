# supervisor-multi-agent-system

## Overview

This project implements a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture featuring a central supervisor agent that orchestrates
specialized subordinate agents, served through a FastAPI interface.

## Key Features

- **Task Delegation and Coordination**: Supervisor agent assigns tasks to subordinate AI agents, monitor progress, and
  ensure alignment with overarching objectives.
- **Performance Monitoring**: By evaluating the outputs and behaviors of subordinate agents, supervisor AI agents
  maintain quality and efficiency, intervening when necessary to correct deviations.
- **Decision Support**: By integrating insights from multiple agents, the supervisor provides high-level decision-making
  assistance, optimizing workflow execution and improving overall system intelligence.
- **Communication Management**: Structured flow of information between agents, enabling smooth inter-agent
  collaboration.
- **Hierarchical Structuring**: Supports multi-level hierarchies, allowing the supervisor to manage other supervisors,
  facilitating scalable, distributed, and complex AI-driven workflows.
